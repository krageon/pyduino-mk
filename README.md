# PyDuino-MK
A simple Python API that interacts (via serial communication) with Arduino devices for USB mouse and keyboard emulation. It is compatible with all Arduino devices (Leonardo, Micro, etc.) that support the [Arduino Mouse/Keyboard libraries](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference.MouseKeyboard).

# Installation
To install PyDuino-MK from the PyPI repository, run the following from a command line:

```
pip install pyduino_mk
```
To install PyDuino-MK locally from the source directory, `cd` to the `python` directory containing `setup.py` and run:

```
python setup.py build install
```

# Setup
1. Plug your Arduino device into a computer via USB.
2. `cd` to the `arduino` folder and open the `arduino.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
3. Upload the sketch to the Arduino device.

After the Arduino sketch has been uploaded, the Arduino device is now ready to accept serial messages from the Python API.

# Usage
To use PyDuino-MK, you must first import the Arduino-MK mouse/keyboard constants and the `Arduino` class encapsulating the Arduino commands. The mouse/keyboard constants are used to designate mouse buttons (i.e. `MOUSE_LEFT`, `MOUSE_RIGHT`) and keyboard keys (i.e. `F1`, `CTRL`, `INSERT`).

```python
from pyduino_mk.constants import *
from pyduino_mk import Arduino
```

Instantiating the `Arduino` class is simple and easy.

```python
arduino = Arduino()
```

PyDuino-MK automatically detects and establishes a connection with the serial port that the Arduino device resides on. But if for any reason PyDuino-MK is unable to do so, a port can be explicitly provided as an optional parameter.

```python
arduino = Arduino(port='COM5')  # Windows example
```

```python
arduino = Arduino(port='/dev/tty.usbmodemfa141')  # OSX example
```

```python
arduino = Arduino(port='/dev/ttyS2')  # Linux example
```

## Moving the Mouse
PyDuino-MK provides a couple of modules for moving the mouse from one location to another. These modules take two arguments that represent a Cartesian coordinate. A coordinate system where the top-left of the screen represents the origin, `(0, 0)`, such that pixel coordinates increase in the right and down directions is assumed.

```python
# Calling this module will move the mouse from the current mouse position to 
# a specified mouse position in a linear motion.
arduino.move(300, 300)
```

```python
# Calling this module will move the mouse from the current mouse position to 
# a specified mouse position in a cubic bezier motion. This module generates
# two random control points every call to vary the mouse paths.
arduino.bezier_move(300, 300)
```

## Clicking the Mouse
To click using the mouse, call the `click(button)` module. This module holds down the designated button for a random interval between 50-100ms and then releases the button to resemble a human-like click motion.

All of the click modules have the default parameter value, `MOUSE_LEFT`.

```python
# Left-click (2 ways)
arduino.click()
arduino.click(MOUSE_LEFT)
```

```python
# Middle-click
arduino.click(MOUSE_MIDDLE)
```

```python
# Right-click
arduino.click(MOUSE_RIGHT)
```

To click without briefly holding the mouse button down, use the `fast_click(button)` module.

```python
# Auto-click very quickly
while True:
	arduino.fast_click(MOUSE_LEFT)
```

Use the `press(button)` and `release(button)` modules to hold down a mouse button and release it on command.

```python
import time

# Hold the right mouse button for 5 seconds
arduino.press(MOUSE_RIGHT)
time.sleep(5)
arduino.release(MOUSE_RIGHT)
```

```python
# Drag the left mouse button to (500, 500)
arduino.press()
arduino.bezier_move(500, 500)
arduino.release()
```

## Using the Keyboard
To send a character or a string **as a single keystroke**, use the `write(character)` or `write(string)` module.

All keyboard modules will work **only** with ASCII characters that correspond to a key on the keyboard. With the exception of backspace, passing the ASCII codes for non-printable characters as arguments will produce undefined results.

However, modifier keys (such as Ctrl, Shift, Alt) may be passed as arguments. The modifier key constants are available and can be imported from `pyduino_mk.constants`. The names of the constants are almost identical to the [Arduino keyboard modifiers](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/KeyboardModifiers). The only difference is that the constants omit the `KEY_` prefix. `KEY_LEFT_CTRL` becomes `LEFT_CTRL`, `KEY_CAPS_LOCK` becomes `CAPS_LOCK`, and so on.

```python
# Write the letter 'A' in two ways. A character or an integer ordinal 
# representing the character can be used as an argument.
arduino.write('A')
arduino.write(65)
```

```python
# Write 'Hello world!' through the Arduino keyboard as a single keystroke.
arduino.write('Hello world!')
```

Like the mouse, keyboard keys can also be held down and released. The `press(button)` and `release(button)` modules are overloaded for the keyboard. `releaseAll()` can be used to release all keys that are held down.

```python
# Hit Ctrl+Alt+Delete
arduino.press(LEFT_CTRL)
arduino.press(LEFT_ALT)
arduino.press(DELETE)
arduino.releaseAll()
```

## Realistic Human Typing
Instead of writing messages as a single keystroke, messages may also be sent as a series of keystrokes. One of the extended keyboard functionality provided by PyDuino-MK is human typing emulation. This is available through the `type(string)` module. By default, the module will type at a rate of 80 wpm at 96% accuracy. If mistakes occur, the Arduino will pause for a brief moment and correct the mistake. Mistakes may be disabled for 100% accuracy if desired.

```python
# 80 wpm with 85% accuracy
arduino.type('https://github.com/nelsontran/PyDuino-MK/', accuracy=85)
```

![typing](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10904556/8180364/ffa5fd22-13d1-11e5-9b7b-0b76537b862f.gif)

### Optional parameters
* `wpm` (int) - words per minute (assuming 5 characters per word) **without** taking mistakes into account.
* `mistakes` (bool) - True/False value that determines whether to make mistakes or not.
* `accuracy` (int) - Value between 1 and 100, representing a percentage, that determines typing accuracy.

# Notes
Keep in mind that all of the Arduino modules are blocking until the Arduino device has completed the action. For example, calling `move(destination)` will cause the Python script to hang until the Arduino has finished moving the cursor to the destination. If you call `type()` with a long message and a slow WPM with low accuracy, expect to wait a while for the call to finish.
